ISRIB Rescue Analysis: Biological Insights
========================================

1. Global Impact of ISRIB Treatment
---------------------------------
- Large-scale rescue effect: 2423 proteins show significant rescue
- Robust rescue magnitude: Mean Log2FC improvement of 1.536
- Consistent rescue effect: Low variability (Std Dev: 0.907)
- Distribution suggests systematic rescue:
  * 25th percentile: 0.915
  * Median: 1.302
  * 75th percentile: 1.861

2. Category-Specific Rescue Patterns
----------------------------------
A. TOM Complex (Import Machinery):
   - Highest proportion of rescue: 5 out of 6 proteins (83%)
   - Most moderate initial decrease (Mean CCCP Log2FC: -1.622)
   - Strong recovery (Mean CCCP+ISRIB Log2FC: -0.212)
   - Consistent rescue magnitude (1.409)
   Hypothesis: ISRIB effectively preserves import machinery functionality

B. Mitochondrial Small Ribosomal Subunit:
   - Moderate rescue rate: 16 out of 26 proteins (62%)
   - Severe initial impact (Mean CCCP Log2FC: -4.438)
   - Partial recovery (Mean CCCP+ISRIB Log2FC: -3.216)
   - Modest rescue magnitude (1.222)
   Hypothesis: Translation machinery components show differential sensitivity to ISRIB rescue

C. Respiratory Complex I:
   - Good rescue rate: 33 out of 49 proteins (67%)
   - Strong initial decrease (Mean CCCP Log2FC: -4.185)
   - Partial recovery (Mean CCCP+ISRIB Log2FC: -2.747)
   - Substantial rescue magnitude (1.438)
   Hypothesis: ISRIB partially preserves respiratory chain component import

D. Mitochondrial Genome-Encoded Proteins:
   - Limited rescue: 2 out of 7 proteins (29%)
   - Significant initial impact (Mean CCCP Log2FC: -3.924)
   - Partial recovery (Mean CCCP+ISRIB Log2FC: -2.375)
   - Strong rescue magnitude when it occurs (1.549)
   Hypothesis: ISRIB's effect extends beyond nuclear-encoded proteins

3. Exceptional Cases
------------------
A. Most Dramatically Rescued Proteins:
   - Top rescue magnitudes range from 5.8 to 7.7
   - Several proteins show complete reversal from negative to positive Log2FC
   - Notable examples:
     * Q12933: -5.888 to 1.774 (Δ7.662)
     * Q6PCD5: -7.023 to 0.470 (Δ7.492)
     * Q9Y2X7: -4.782 to 2.219 (Δ7.001)

B. Upregulated Proteins:
   - Only 4 proteins significantly upregulated by CCCP
   - 2 show sustained upregulation with ISRIB
   - 2 return to baseline with ISRIB
   Hypothesis: ISRIB selectively maintains stress responses

4. Mechanistic Insights
----------------------
1. Hierarchical Rescue Pattern:
   TOM Complex (83%) > Complex I (67%) > Mito Ribosomes (62%) > Mt-encoded (29%)
   Suggests:
   - Import machinery preservation is prioritized
   - Component complexity influences rescue efficiency
   - Distance from import machinery may affect rescue potential

2. Rescue Magnitude Pattern:
   Mt-encoded (1.549) > Complex I (1.438) > TOM (1.409) > Mito Ribosomes (1.222)
   Suggests:
   - When rescue occurs, it's most effective for basic mitochondrial functions
   - Complex assemblies may have more limited rescue potential

5. Future Research Directions
---------------------------
1. Investigate mechanisms behind selective rescue of specific proteins
2. Examine temporal dynamics of rescue response
3. Study potential compensatory pathways in non-rescued proteins
4. Explore the relationship between protein complexity and rescue efficiency
5. Investigate the role of protein-protein interactions in rescue success

6. Therapeutic Implications
-------------------------
1. ISRIB shows broad protective effects against CCCP-induced mitochondrial stress
2. Preservation of import machinery suggests potential for maintaining mitochondrial function
3. Differential rescue patterns suggest pathway-specific therapeutic opportunities
4. Strong rescue of some severely affected proteins indicates significant therapeutic potential
