Biological Insights and Hypotheses
================================

1. Global Impact of CCCP Treatment
--------------------------------
- Strong overall negative effect on protein levels (Mean Log2FC: -1.552)
- Nearly half of all proteins (2216 out of 4608) show significant changes
- Striking imbalance between up/down regulation:
  * Only 4 proteins significantly upregulated
  * 1960 proteins significantly downregulated
Hypothesis 1: CCCP treatment causes a widespread disruption of mitochondrial protein import, affecting a large portion of the mitochondrial proteome.

2. Mitochondrial Ribosomal Proteins
----------------------------------
- 26 mitochondrial ribosomal proteins identified
- 25 show significant changes (96% affected)
- Severe downregulation (Mean Log2FC: -3.841)
- ALL decreased proteins show strong reduction (Log2FC < -1)
Hypothesis 2: CCCP treatment severely impacts mitochondrial translation machinery, suggesting a specific vulnerability of the mitochondrial ribosomal assembly or import pathway.

3. Complex I Components
----------------------
- 49 Complex I proteins identified
- 45 significantly affected (92% of Complex I proteins)
- Strongest average downregulation (Mean Log2FC: -3.916)
- 100% of proteins show strong decrease
Hypothesis 3: Respiratory Complex I is particularly sensitive to CCCP treatment, suggesting either preferential degradation or impaired import of its components.

4. Import Machinery Components
----------------------------
- TOM complex (6 proteins):
  * 4 significantly affected
  * Moderate downregulation (Mean Log2FC: -1.520)
  * All 6 show decrease
Hypothesis 4: The import machinery itself is affected but to a lesser extent than its substrates, suggesting a potential feedback mechanism rather than direct degradation.

5. Mitochondrial-Encoded Proteins
-------------------------------
- 7 mitochondrial-encoded proteins identified
- 5 significantly affected
- Substantial downregulation (Mean Log2FC: -2.866)
Hypothesis 5: The effect on mitochondrial-encoded proteins suggests that CCCP's impact extends beyond just import, affecting internal mitochondrial protein synthesis or stability.

Integrative Hypotheses
--------------------
1. Hierarchical Vulnerability:
   The differential impact on various protein categories (Complex I > Mito Ribosomes > Mt-encoded > TOM complex) suggests a hierarchical vulnerability to CCCP treatment, possibly related to protein complex assembly dependencies or specific import pathways.

2. Feedback Regulation:
   The moderate effect on import machinery compared to stronger effects on imported proteins suggests a potential protective mechanism for maintaining minimal import capacity.

3. Systemic Response:
   The near-complete absence of upregulated proteins suggests this is not a compensatory response but rather a systematic collapse of mitochondrial protein homeostasis.

Future Investigations
-------------------
1. Analyze the few upregulated proteins for potential stress response elements
2. Investigate the relationship between protein half-life and degree of decrease
3. Examine potential correlation between TargetP scores and protein decrease
4. Study the small subset of non-affected proteins in each category for potential protective features

Technical Notes
-------------
- Total proteins analyzed: 4608
- Significance threshold: p < 0.05 (adjusted)
- Strong statistical power with 2216 significant changes
- Clear biological significance with large effect sizes (many Log2FC < -1)
