3. Key Biological Insights
------------------------
A. Hierarchical Protection:
   - Import machinery preservation appears prioritized
   - Complex assembly components show coordinated rescue
   - Translation machinery shows intermediate recovery
   - Mt-encoded proteins uniquely vulnerable

B. System Integration:
   - Clear evidence of organized cellular response
   - Differential effects based on protein function
   - Suggests active prioritization mechanism

C. Rescue Mechanisms:
   - ISRIB effects are selective and hierarchical
   - Import machinery preservation may be key to overall rescue
   - Complex interdependencies revealed in rescue patterns

4. Major Hypotheses Generated
---------------------------
1. Import Priority Hypothesis:
   - Cells prioritize rescue of import machinery
   - This preservation enables broader protein recovery
   - May represent a fundamental cellular strategy

2. Complex Assembly Hypothesis:
   - Rescue efficiency correlates with complex size/complexity
   - Suggests coordinated assembly mechanism preservation
   - Points to potential regulatory checkpoints

3. Translation Control Hypothesis:
   - Differential effects on nuclear vs mitochondrial genes
   - Suggests complex regulatory mechanisms
   - May indicate separate rescue pathways

5. Clinical/Therapeutic Implications
--------------------------------
1. Treatment Strategy:
   - ISRIB shows broad protective effects
   - Import machinery preservation could be key target
   - Different protein categories may need specific interventions

2. Biomarker Potential:
   - TOM complex proteins as rescue indicators
   - Complex I components as stress markers
   - Mt-encoded proteins as vulnerability indicators

3. Intervention Points:
