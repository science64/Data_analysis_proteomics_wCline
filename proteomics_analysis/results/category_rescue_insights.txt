Category-Specific ISRIB Rescue Analysis
=====================================

1. Hierarchical Rescue Pattern
----------------------------
Rescue Percentage (from highest to lowest):
1. TOM Complex: 83.3% (5/6 proteins)
2. Complex I: 67.3% (33/49 proteins)
3. Mito Ribosomes: 61.5% (16/26 proteins)
4. Mt-encoded: 28.6% (2/7 proteins)

Key Finding: Clear hierarchical pattern in rescue efficiency, with import machinery (TOM) showing the highest rescue rate.

2. Initial CCCP Impact Severity
----------------------------
Severity of CCCP effect (Mean Log2FC):
1. Complex I: -3.916
2. Mito Ribosomes: -3.841
3. Mt-encoded: -2.866
4. TOM Complex: -1.520

Key Finding: Import machinery (TOM) shows the most modest initial decrease, while respiratory chain components are most severely affected.

3. Recovery Patterns
-----------------
Final state after ISRIB (Mean Log2FC):
1. TOM Complex: -0.280 (near baseline)
2. Complex I: -2.991 (partial recovery)
3. Mito Ribosomes: -3.249 (partial recovery)
4. Mt-encoded: -3.547 (further decreased)

4. Rescue Magnitude Analysis
-------------------------
Rescue magnitude (positive indicates improvement):
1. TOM Complex: +1.240 (strongest positive rescue)
2. Complex I: +0.925 (substantial rescue)
3. Mito Ribosomes: +0.592 (moderate rescue)
4. Mt-encoded: -0.680 (negative impact)

5. Biological Implications
-----------------------
a) Import Machinery Preservation:
   - TOM complex shows both the highest rescue percentage and magnitude
   - Suggests prioritized preservation of import capacity
   - Near-baseline recovery indicates functional restoration

b) Respiratory Chain Response:
   - Complex I shows severe initial impact but good rescue rate
   - Large number of affected proteins (49) with consistent rescue pattern
   - Suggests coordinated rescue of respiratory function

c) Translation Machinery:
   - Mito Ribosomes show intermediate rescue efficiency
   - Consistent but partial recovery pattern
   - Indicates maintained but reduced translation capacity

d) Mt-encoded Proteins:
   - Unique negative rescue pattern
   - May indicate indirect effects on mitochondrial gene expression
   - Possible feedback mechanism affecting mitochondrial transcription/translation

6. Mechanistic Insights
---------------------
1. Priority System:
   - Clear evidence of prioritized rescue of import machinery
   - Suggests cellular strategy to maintain essential import function

2. Complex Assembly:
   - Larger complexes (Complex I) show coordinated rescue patterns
   - Suggests preservation of complex assembly pathways

3. System Integration:
   - Differential effects on nuclear vs mitochondrial-encoded proteins
   - Indicates complex interplay between cellular and organellar responses

7. Therapeutic Implications
------------------------
1. Import Machinery:
   - High rescue efficiency suggests potential therapeutic target
   - May be key to maintaining overall mitochondrial function

2. Complex I:
   - Good rescue response despite severe initial impact
   - Suggests potential for functional recovery of respiratory chain

3. Translation System:
   - Moderate rescue indicates potential for protein synthesis recovery
   - May require additional interventions for full restoration

8. Future Research Directions
--------------------------
1. Investigate mechanisms behind differential rescue efficiencies
2. Examine temporal dynamics of rescue process
3. Study the negative impact on mt-encoded proteins
4. Explore potential compensatory mechanisms
5. Investigate protein complex assembly during rescue
